FAQ: How Does Component Scan Work - Your Package Names are Different!
- For the Spring attribute:  base-package="com.luv2code.springdemo"
- Spring will recursively scan for components starting at the base package: "com.luv2code.springdemo"
- When I say "recursive", it means that Spring will start at the base package and scan all sub packages.
