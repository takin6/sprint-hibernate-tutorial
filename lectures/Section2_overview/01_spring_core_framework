Goals of Spring
- Lightweight development with Java POJOS (Plain Old Java Objects)
- Dependency injection to promote loose coupling
- Declarative programming with Aspect-Oriented-Programming (AOP)
- Minimize boilerplate Java code

Spring Architecture
- Core Container : factory for creating beans, manage bean dependencies
- AOP : allows you to create applicationwide services like logging, security, transactions, instrumentation
        you can apply these services to your objects in a declarative fasion, so no need to modify you code to have support for this
- Data Access Layer : JDBC, ORM, Transactions, JMS,
- Web Layer: Full MVC Framework (Servlet, WebSocket, Web)
- Infrastructure: instrumentation model
- Test Layer: mock, integration, unit
