Inversion of Control
- The design process of externalizing, the construction and management of your objects
- Your application is going to outsource the creation and management of the objects
- That outsourcing will be handled by a object factory

Primary Functions of Spring Container
- Create and manage objects (inversion of control) - with object factory
- Inject object's dependencies (Dependency Injection)

Configuring Spring Container
- XML configuration file
- Java Annotations
- Java Source Code

Spring Development Process
Step1. Configure your Spring Beans (Java object)
Step2. Create a Spring Container
- Spring container is generally known as ApplicationContext
- Specialized Implementations
    - ClassPathXmlApplicationContext
    - AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
    - GenericWebApplicationContext
    - others...
- ClassPathXmlApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("application.xml")
Step3. Retrieve Beans from Container
- Coach theCoach = context.getBean("myCoach", Coach.class);
